![Asus Zenbook UX301LA Front]({{site.url}}/assets/images/selling-laptop/laptop-front.jpg  "Asus Zenbook UX301LA Front")

I'm selling my laptop for no particular reason. I've enjoyed it since I bought it on 2014. I still love the design, have a good battery experience and consider it one of the best ultrabooks in the market.

However for work reasons I want to buy a MacBook Pro. I'd love to install MacOS X in this machine but, despite sharing a lot of hardware with Apple's laptop, I don't really want to go through the hasle of visiting forums, installing pirate software, try patches, etc.

## Technical Specifications

The exact model is Asus Zenbook UX301LA-DH71T, which means you would enjoy the following technical specifications

| Type 	| Value						|
| -----------| ------------------------------------------	|
| CPU	| Intel Core i7 (3.3 GB) 			|
| RAM	| 8 GB DD3					|
| HDD	| 256 GB SSD					|
| Display	| 13.3" WQHD Touch Screen (*)	|
| Weight	| Just 1.4 kg (battery included) 	|
| SO		| Windows 8.1 (free upgrade to Windows 10) |
| Sound 	| Bang & Olufsen technology		|

( * ) The display offers a resolution similar to MacBook Pro **Retina** display.

## The good parts

Personally, the things I like the most about this laptop are:

- I love the **design**. It's all cover in Gorilla Glass 3, which makes it look amazing and totally different to other laptops out there.
- It is **really fast**. The combination of Intel Core i7, SSD disks and plenty of RAM means performance for any tasks, development included.
- **Excelent screen** and **excelent sound**. Both are top-notch, as good or even better than MacBook Pro.
- ** Linux friendly**. I'm writing this from Ubuntu and all hardware in the laptop is working fine, even things like the keyword backlit, WiFi, MiniHDMI output or most Fn keys. I haven't tried the SD card reader.

## The less good parts

This is an American laptop, this model with the Retina-alike display is sold only there. In the UK you can get a similar model with a normal HD display instead. That is not bad on itself, but means two things:

- The keyboard is an American International keyboard. It hasn't been a problem for me at all and I'll be ordering my next laptop with that type of keyboard, but it's something to be aware of.
- The power adapter is American too. You'll need a UK adapter, which costs 1-2 £ on Amazon.
- I lost the USB-to-Ethernet adapter that can originally with the laptop. I have everything else though (the box, the leather cover, etc.)

## How much is this?

**I'm selling it for 850 £**. I paid twice that less than two years ago. I'm aware hardware gets "obsolete" pretty quickly, but if I compare the hardware of this laptop with a new MacBook Pro 13" and only CPU and Graphic Card are superior, and it costs more than 1300 £.
