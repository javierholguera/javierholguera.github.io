<p>Some time ago I came across a great resource for software developers, no matters what language or platform they use. This is the <a href="http://www.planetgeek.ch/2013/06/05/clean-code-cheat-sheet/">Clean Code Cheat Sheet</a>, created by Urs Enzler.</p>
<p><a href="http://javi.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image.png"><img style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb.png" width="681" height="385" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In this cheat sheet Urs describe different good and bad ideas and practices for different practices, from just writing code to testing, integration and packaging. Personally I find a lot of value in the bad practices, because while good practices tend to change in time and have a great debate around them, bad practices tend to remain stable and offer a bigger consensus.</p>
<p>Provided I consider this such a great resource, I have decided to start a series of blog posts regarding different good and bad practices explained in this cheat sheet. My goal is to delve on these practices with further description and real world examples and use cases, when possible.</p>
<p>It should be a pleasant way to learn more about them, either from my own experimentation or from comments and feedback from the blog readers.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
